# Port-Swigger-Web-Security-Academy-Attack-Scripts

An assortment of WIP attack scripts I wrote in Typescript for Port Swigger's Web Security Academy labs. 

This repo is more of a showcase of my notes going through the course. If you do want to run the scripts though, follow the instructions below.


To set up, install the latest version of Node, pull this repo, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

To run the scripts, replace the `subdomain` variable with the subdomain value generated by the respective labs in Port Swigger's Web Security Academy.

Then, run `ts-node` with the file path as the parameter.
